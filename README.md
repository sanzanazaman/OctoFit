# OctoFit


In this hands-on skills session, I took on the role of a gym teacher developing OctoFit Tracker, a social fitness app designed to help students stay active and compete with their peers. Using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, I rapidly built a functional prototype while learning best practices for AI-assisted development.

Workshop objectives

By the end of this workshop, I:
- Set up a development environment using GitHub Codespaces
- Used GitHub Copilot to accelerate app development
- Implemented core features of OctoFit Tracker with Copilot Agent Mode
- Applied best practices for prompting and refining AI-generated code

Application features

OctoFit Tracker includes:
- User profiles for students and gym teachers
- Activity tracking to monitor fitness progress
- Team creation and management for collaborative goals
- Leaderboards to rank student performance
- Personalized workout suggestions to help students improve
